# Class Portfolio
## DES INV 23: Creative Programming And Electronics
**Summer 2020 | Joshua Rafael Sanchez, UC Berkeley**

## Introduction:
Welcome! This is my portfolio of all projects created in UC Berkeley's creative programming and electronics course (DES INV 23). Made in Processing (Version 3.5.4) and made in Arduino (Version 1.8.13) using the Sparkfun Inventor's Kit. 

All projects are my own.  Feel free to explore the documentation of the artworks and the visualizations I have made through the links provided below.  Feel free to drop by with questions or comments at joshuarafael@berkeley.edu.  Thank you!

	| "Sound Experience (sound.exp) dissembles the aspects of a song and transforms them into components of art. Using the tools of Processing coding and Arduino robotics, the project allows the participant to change what they see in front of them with only a click or a slight movement of a part. Use this program with any MP3 file, and see your music come to life!" |  Final Project |
