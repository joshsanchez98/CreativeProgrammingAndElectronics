## DES INV 23: Creative Programming And Electronics
**Summer 2020 | Joshua Rafael Sanchez, UC Berkeley**

## Introduction:
Welcome! This is my portfolio of all projects created in UC Berkeley's creative programming and electronics course (DES INV 23). Made in Processing (Version 3.5.4) and made in Arduino (Version 1.8.13) using the Sparkfun Inventor's Kit. 

All projects are my own.  Feel free to explore the documentation of the artworks and the visualizations I have made through the links provided below.  Feel free to drop by with questions or comments at joshuarafael@berkeley.edu.  Thank you!
