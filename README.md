# Class Portfolio
## DES INV 23: Creative Programming And Electronics
**Summer 2020 | Joshua Rafael Sanchez, UC Berkeley**

## Introduction:
Welcome! This is my portfolio of all projects created in UC Berkeley's creative programming and electronics course (DES INV 23). Made in Processing (Version 3.5.4) and made in Arduino (Version 1.8.13) using the Sparkfun Inventor's Kit. 

All projects are my own.  The purpose of this document is to showcase my coding, art and design skills. Each project includes documentation about which libraries and tools I have used to create the work and project.

Feel free to explore the documentation through the links provided below.  Feel free to drop by with questions or comments at joshuarafael@berkeley.edu.  Thank you!

| Project Name 	| Photo			| Short Description	| Notes			|
| ------------------- 	| ------------------		| ---------------------	| -------------------	|
| [Sound Experience](https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/tree/master/finalProjectSummer2020)	| <img src = 'https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/blob/master/finalProjectSummer2020/screen4.png'> 	| "Sound Experience (sound.exp) dissembles the aspects of a song and transforms them into components of art. Using the tools of Processing coding and Arduino robotics, the project allows the participant to change what they see in front of them with only a click or a slight movement of a part. Use this program with any MP3 file, and see your music come to life!" |  Final Project |
| [Shakira-Inspired Instrument](https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/tree/master/July_27) 	| <img src="https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/blob/master/July_27/IMG_7707.JPG">	| For my instrument, I decided to create one based on Shakira’s “Hips Don’t Lie” song.  Using Arduino, I created code and synced that with Servo motors and assembled an appropriate instrument to create a setup that allows the user to make different sounds in tune with the music.  The song plays in the form of a tune from the small speaker.	| Arduino Project | 
| [Introduction to Arduino](https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/tree/master/July_22)	| <img src="https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/blob/master/July_22/animated.gif">	| I used Arduino 1.8.13, as well as a basic kit of wires, a breadboard, and Arduino, as well as LED lights, resistors, and buttons. I used a simple LED, wire and resistor configuration before moving on to more advanced stages in order to quality check my work. | Arduino Introduction | 
| [Fix the TV Game](https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/tree/master/Midterm)	| <img src="https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/blob/master/Midterm/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-20%20at%204.13.04%20AM.png">	| “Your job is to fix the TV to get to watching your favorite show at the best quality possible. Click on the correct part of the screen with your cursor.  To find out where to click, you have to wave the cursor around the screen, and the sound will change.  Depending on how careful you were and quick you were with fixing the TV,  the outcome either will be a fast-speed, high-quality retina-quality video just like you bought, or a slowed-down and poor quality video due to your unscrupulous tampering of your beloved television.” | Processing Project |
| [Four Corners Ping-Pong Game](https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/tree/master/July_15) | <img src="https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/blob/master/July_15/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-15%20at%202.59.54%20AM.png">	| Let’s play ping-pong, with a twist! I decided to make a simple game of ping-pong to start familiarizing myself with the interactivity of the mouse and the program. The object of the game is to keep the ball inside of the screen. Use your mouse to guide each of the four walls to keep your ball inside the screen. | Processing Project |
| [Work of Art](https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/tree/master/July_13) | <img src="https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/blob/master/July_13/my_image.png"> | I created an artwork from the inspiration of Casey Reas, Nonotak, and Truchet Tiles.  This artwork is a live artwork instilled with vibrant colors, rotating images, and regenerating art pieces. | Processing Artwork |
| [Simple Self-Portrait](https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/tree/master/July_8) | <img src="https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/blob/master/July_8/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-08%20at%201.42.23%20AM.png"> | I would describe myself as adventurous and as a go-getter. Therefore, I wanted to show that throughout the entire course of the day, I keep myself occupied in mind, body and spirit. Originally, I wanted to also add a lot more detail, but however, I feel that the syntax about going through the program would take a while. | Processing Artwork |
