# Final Project: Sound Experience

**Overview**

**Idea Generation and Inspiration**

**Software and Hardware Tools Used**

**Creation Process**
1) **First iteration: Input MP3 track and have artwork that is generated change along with the music.  Only Processing.** I tried the demo Processing 3.5.4. Included, namely AudioWaveform, PeakAmplitude, and FFTSpectrum under the Sound library.  I had referenced code from these three examples to start generating inspiration.

**Final Presentation**

**A Wrap-Up, Reflection and More Interesting Tidbits**
- **MP3 in Processing slows down the song.** I tried running my file through MP4 and MP3 free files converters online, namely [Zamzar](https://zamzar.com) and [cloudconvert](https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-to-mp3).  Unfortunately, despite the converted files seemingly working fine on Quicktime, when downloading into Processing the song would be slowed to a lower tempo, thus changing the entire key of the song.
- **Minim is the older library from Processing 2 and earlier, Sound is the newer library in Processing.** I noticed through discussing with colleagues that Processing had a library called Minim and there is some documentation for that library.  I ended up using the newer Sound library instead.
