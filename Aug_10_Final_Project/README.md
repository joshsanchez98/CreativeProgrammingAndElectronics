# Final Project Update: August 10th

**Overview:** So far, I have been able to have the project work at a bare minimum.  The bare minimum is that the artwork is generated by the MP3 and MP4 files in real-time.  The majority of my time has been spent researching how to incorporate audio files, and after much researching, I had finally incorporated several songs into the artwork.  The artwork looks somewhat decent right now, but it lacks a very coherent background and lacks a lot of complexity.

**Next Steps:** I wish to continue by further amplifying the artwork by making it more interactive and creative. Additionally, because it is most likely not sophisticated enough, I would like to incorporate Arduino to at least have the controls mainpulate the artwork.
