**Description of Game, Fix the TV:**

- Objective: Your job is to fix the TV to get to watching your favorite show at the best quality possible.
- How to Fix the TV:  Click on the correct part of the screen with your cursor.  To find out where to click, you have to wave the cursor around the screen, and the sound will change.  
-- When the sound becomes the loudest static sound that you can possibly hear, click on the spot, and you may or may not get scored, depending on your accuracy, and then you move on to the next screen, or the next problem..
- Outcome: Depending on how careful you were and quick you were with fixing the TV,  the outcome either will be a fast-speed, high-quality retina-quality video just like you bought, or a slowed-down and poor quality video due to your unscrupulous tampering of your beloved television. Or, it might not even work at all. 

**Challenges:**
- Getting the processing.video to work.  I needed to find a way to connect my webcam to my Processing code, which was absolutely necessary for my project to function.  *Therefore, I ended up importing video instead of using webcam for the time being.* I was using Mac OS Mojave Version 10.14.6; a recent version did not work correctly on the Mac and ended up trying the the following sources:
Github thread for Mac OS Catalina users: [Link.](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/134#issuecomment-550359384)
- Asking fellow classmates and Professor for assistance.
- Getting the processing.sound to work.  Similar to issue above, I had trouble connecting my Processing file with my microphone.  *Therefore, I ended up importing audio instead of using my microphone for the time being.*
- Positioning the pixels for the TV.  Because the pixels were numbered by a long string/array, I had to use some mental math and visualization to be able to generate the static in the place which I had wanted to.
