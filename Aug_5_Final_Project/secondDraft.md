# 2nd Draft Proposal: Sound Experience

**Overall Changes From Previous Draft**
- Inspirations for Art: Adding Reza Ali as an inspriation, after seeing [Megan's presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nMK23bF0SbIPO7mAfqlUKXqwxKJc16b8IlMIqiGY7CE/edit#slide=id.g8ef4d00c0a_0_2) about Reza Ali in class.

**Overview:** 
My proposal is a two-part proposal.  I call the overall project, “Sound Experience.” The inspiration comes from my experience with music creation and exploration; a hobby of mine is to explore new types of music as well as create art visuals, so I thought my final project would be the perfect opportunity to put on display my fascination with both art and music mediums through showcasing the technical skills gained in class using both Processing and Arduino.
 
**Inspirations for Art:**
- Ryoji Ikeda: The Transfinite. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omDK2Cm2mwo)  I love how he uses the simplicity of manipulating the order of long white lines but uses the contrast of light and dark accompanied with static-like sound to accentuate and to emphasize the visual and audio aspects to create a trance-like atmosphere. 
- Truchet Tiles (Former Project). [Link](https://github.com/joshsanchez98/CreativeProgrammingAndElectronics/tree/master/July_13) I had generated random rotating Pacman-looking visuals in opposite colors to create an appealing, fun, and engaging visual.  Hopefully, this may be incorporated into the Processing project.
- The Ancient Art of Painting on Water. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeGqnicNS2A) I saw this artist, Garip Ay, who creates art pieces using an ancient Turkish technique called *ebru* of painting on water.  I was mesmerized by the dynamicness/movement of the colors changing, so it would be really cool to mimic that piece of art in my project.
- Reza Ali.  [Link](https://www.syedrezaali.com/) Ali is a computational designer, software engineer and artist. What inspires me the most about his artwork is his incorporation of computer algorithms into design, and as his work is featured in many places and software companies, as well as in music with Deadmau5, he would be another great artist to look up to for inspiration.

**Part 1:** 
My first part is to create an interactive project where users can input their songs, and from that input, the user can view generated artworks that change according to the settings that are either 1) defined by the user manually or 2) pre-defined according to the aspects of the song (length, structure, amplitude, genre, etc.) 
*Software/Hardware Tools: Web design libraries (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and Processing*: 
- Processing: Creates the visuals on a generated screen iteratively, and will play the MP4 provided. 
- Web Design Libraries: Will to utilized to design an web interface where the user may interact and import songs and establish settings for the artwork to follow.

**Part 2:** 
My second part is to allow users to physically manipulate the visuals they see as well as make a robot dance from commands in a breadboard. 
*Software/Hardware Tools: Processing, Arduino (all materials included in Sparkfun Toolkit)*:
- Processing: Visuals would be manipulated depending on the commands given from the breadboard.
- Arduino: Use Arduino Uno, LED lights, switches, and motors to generate movement of the robot. 
- Miscellaneous Items: Toilet paper rolls, glue, and other various house items to construct the robot, as there is no access to a Makerspace.
