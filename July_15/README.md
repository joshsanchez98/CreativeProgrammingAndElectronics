**Description of Art**

I decided to make a simple game of ping-pong to start familiarizing myself with the interactivity of the mouse and the program.  
- The object of the game is to keep the ball inside of the screen.  
- Use your mouse to guide each of the four walls to keep your ball inside the screen.
- Every bounce on one of the four walls scores 1 point. 
- The game keeps track of your highest score.  

I've also created some
features to make the game more visually appealing, such as playing with font visuals as well as the finished screen.  

**Difficulties, Interesting Things and Other Notes**
- When the ball hits any of the four walls, the program would sometimes glitch, the ball would fall through the walls, and then spam the score counter approximately
5-10 points to give a wrong higher score.  I'm assuming this result is due to either my computer's weak relative processing power or the large amount of 
commands which I am giving the program.
