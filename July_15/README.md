**Description of Art**

I decided to make a simple game of ping-pong to start familiarizing myself with the interactivity of the mouse and the program.  
- The object of the game is to keep the ball inside of the screen.  
- Use your mouse to guide each of the four walls to keep your ball inside the screen.
- Every bounce on one of the four walls scores 1 point. 
- The game keeps track of your highest score.  

I've also created some
features to make the game more visually appealing, such as 
- playing with font visuals,
- having the red value of the RGB deepen after every point earned,
- playing with the visuals of the finish screen overall.  

**Difficulties, Interesting Things and Other Notes**
- When the ball hits any of the four walls, the program would sometimes glitch, the ball would fall through the walls, and then spam the score counter approximately
5-10 points to give a wrong higher score.  I'm assuming this result is due to either my computer's weak relative processing power or the large amount of 
commands which I am giving the program.
