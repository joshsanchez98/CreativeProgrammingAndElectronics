# Production Assignment: Simple Self-Portrait

**Description of Environment ** 

Hi everyone! I would describe myself as adventurous and as a go-getter.  Therefore, I wanted to show that throughout the entire course of the day, I keep myself occupied both academically, professionally, personally, and emotionally.  

During the day, I enjoy traveling and going to the beach.  I have been a competitve swimmer throughout high school, and I continue to swim daily, while also staying outside whenever I can.  I am also a weather-moody person, so I want to emphasize that I enjoy being in the sun.  

During the night, I enjoy driving along the skylines and exploring the city.  I tried to depict the Los Angeles skyline here (I am originally from Los Angeles), with famous buildings such as the US Bank Building, Korean Air, and the Bank of America Plaza.  The skyline also constantly changes.

All the while, I love listening and producing music while going about my day, which is represented by the headphones; I listen to music constantly, no matter if I am in school, or at work, or commuting-- it gets me through the day.  In fact, I am taking steps to make music creation my hobby. Additionally, I dressed myself in a sweater and jeans because I want to know that I tend to try to keep myself to a certain standard.
