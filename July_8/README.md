# Production Assignment: Simple Self-Portrait

**Description of Environment** 

Hi everyone! I would describe myself as adventurous and as a go-getter.  Therefore, I wanted to show that throughout the entire course of the day, I keep myself occupied both academically, professionally, personally, and emotionally.  

- During the day, I enjoy traveling and going to the beach.  I have been a competitve swimmer throughout high school, and I continue to swim daily, while also staying outside whenever I can.  I am also a weather-moody person, so I want to emphasize that I enjoy being in the sun.  

- During the night, I enjoy driving along the skylines and exploring the city.  I tried to depict the Los Angeles skyline here (I am originally from Los Angeles), with famous buildings such as the US Bank Building, Korean Air, and the Bank of America Plaza.  The skyline also constantly changes.

- All the while, I love listening and producing music while going about my day, which is represented by the headphones; I listen to music constantly, no matter if I am in school, or at work, or commuting-- it gets me through the day.  In fact, I am taking steps to make music creation my hobby. 

- Additionally, I dressed myself in a sweater and jeans because I want to know that I tend to try to keep myself to a certain standard.

**Difficulties and Problems Encountered, and Further Comments**

This took me a long time to make; nearly 4 hours to make as I am only a beginner-level programmer, and I had never used Processing prior. I was pretty ambitious.  Originally, I wanted to also add a lot more detail, but however, I feel that the syntax about going through the program would take a while.

- I had to use the function `strokeWeight()` to change the dimensions of my lines.
- I needed to draw out the shape and draw out the dimensions myself.  
-- Ex: Transition from a rectangle to a triangle.
-- Ex: Trying to get everything symmetrical.

I wish I had taken this step-by-step process instead:
- 1) First, create the entity completely.
- 2) Then, move the entity to its desired position.

When making the body, it was always difficult to press the play button over and over again.  
- When getting the shape of the figure, I didnâ€™t want to use `quad()`; difficult to pinpoint exact points.
- When making the arms, I had attempted to rotate the shape by using `rotate()`, but many other parts kept moving, so I opted out. 

I also did my best to depict the details within the palm tree, as well as the details about the Los Angeles skyline, through lines, arcs, and randomly generated shapes.  This introduction to static programming in Processing (Version 3.5.4) was fascinating to undergo.
