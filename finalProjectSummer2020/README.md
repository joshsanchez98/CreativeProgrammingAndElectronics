# Final Project: Sound Experience [sound.exp]

### **Overview**


### **Idea Generation and Inspiration**


### **Software and Hardware Tools Used**
- **Processing 3** Processing is an open project initiated by Ben Fry and Casey Rias. This software has been used to specifically create the images on the desktop associated with this project.  I am specifically using Version Processing 3.5.4.
- **Arduino** All of the Arduino-based devices are from [this](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15267) Sparkfun's Inventor Kit.

### **Creation Process**
1) **First iteration: Input MP3 track and have artwork that is generated change along with the music.  Only Processing.**I tried the demo Processing 3.5.4. Included, namely AudioWaveform, PeakAmplitude, and FFTSpectrum under the Sound library.  I had referenced code from these three examples to start generating inspiration.  This was successful after using the tool [AllToMP3](https://alltomp3.org/) to convert my Spotify songs to MP3, and then incorporate those MP3 files into the Processing code. 
2) **Second iteration: Generate unique backgrounds to accompany basic functionalities. Only Processing.** After confirming successful functionality, I continued to reference several other examples.  In this stage I created several different themes using the knowledge I have about creating shape generation, transformation, color manipulation, classes, and the like.  
Final Presentation

### **A Wrap-Up, Reflection and More Interesting Tidbits**
- **MP3 in Processing slows down the song.** I tried running my file through MP4 and MP3 free files converters online, namely [Zamzar](https://zamzar.com) and [cloudconvert](https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-to-mp3).  Unfortunately, despite the converted files seemingly working fine on Quicktime, when downloading into Processing the song would be slowed to a lower tempo, thus changing the entire key of the song.
- **Minim is the older library from Processing 2 and earlier, Sound is the newer library in Processing.** I noticed through discussing with colleagues that Processing had a library called Minim and there is some documentation for that library.  I ended up using the newer Sound library instead.
