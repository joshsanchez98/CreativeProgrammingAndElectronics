**Overview:**
I decided to do my presentation assignment on Ryoji Ikeda, a leading electronic composer and visual artist from Japan.  I had found Ikeda’s works displayed under “Inspiration” under the Summer 2019 website from Kuan-Ju Wu, where when I stumbled across the works, I was mesmerized by the incorporation of sounds and visuals in his works.  I think that he would be a great inspiration for my final project.
 
**Personal LIfe:**
Ikeda was born in Gifu, Japan, which is the countryside of Japan. Early in his teenage years, he started going into music by playing guitar in a rock band at age 13.  He actually ended up studying at the University of Tokyo at age 18, but he proclaims that “I studied nothing.” He spent most nights DJ’ing in clubs, and after college, he ended up starting as a composer for a multimedia art group called Dumb Type.  Dumb Type aims to express the new and daily life of the twentieth century modern and technological world of Japan, where they incorporate visual arts, theatre, dance, architecture, music composition, and computer programming.
 
**Artistic Background:**
Ikeda seems to use mathematical programming in the context of having the thought still be abstract and appreciated as such; Ikeda seems to not have a context to his work. I thought this was a good quote: “I have a very strong belief–a policy–to **not give any interviews**….I really don’t want to speak about any concepts. Because **there are no concepts**....If I say something that is a kind of answer, the audience will be stuck in what I am saying. **And there are infinitely many answers**.” I thought it was an interesting perspective to be saying that, given that he uses some mathematical concepts which exhibit order in his work.  In fact, he “orchestrates sound, visuals, materials, physical phenomena, and mathematical emotions into immersive live performances and installations.”  He also admits, “The installation speaks better than me.”
 
**Selected Works:**
The works I chose were not only his most popular, but also his most stunning most visually, audio-wise, and emotional-wise.  His art seems to put people in a trance-like state.
