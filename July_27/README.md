# Production Assignment: Shakira-Inspired Instrument

**Project Description**

For my instrument, I decided to create one based on Shakira’s “Hips Don’t Lie” song.  Here are the features:
- Green button w/ high photovoltaic sensor reading: Spin servo motor with rocks (rain sound in maracas)
- Red button w/ high photovoltaic sensor reading: Spin servo motor with pinto beans (hollow sound in maracas)
- Green button w/ low photovoltaic sensor reading: Intro of “Hips Don’t Lie”
- Red button w/ low photovoltaic sensor reading: Pre-Chorus of “Hips Don’t Lie”
- Green & Red button w/ low photovoltaic sensor reading: Chorus of “Hips Don’t Lie”
- Potentiometer: Adjust the speed of the servo motors. 

**Things That Were Clever Or Tricky**

- Making the Shakira song.  I had to listen to the song carefully, and make sure to review my sheet music, as it was helpful in this exercise!
- Understanding the theme.  Initially, I wanted to do a Star Wars Theme, but because the instruments didn’t make good background sounds, I opted to keep the instruments (containers filled to the brim with rock or pinto beans being spun around). And after hearing the instruments, my mom suggested that they sound like - maracas, so I thought about Shakira, and that’s how the idea came about.
- Used a second servo motor. I had an extra servo motor (not part of the kit), so I decided to utilize that.
- Used tape and sticky notes to extend the arms attached to the servo motors to more easily move the contents around in the container.  (See images below.) 

**Problems and How They Were Overcame**

- Troubleshooting the second servo.  The second servo didn’t work initially; make sure to unplug and replug the servo, because that is what worked for me. 
- Setting up the Servo motors.  This is more of a mechanical challenge than a coding one. I had no access to some sort of 3D printer or speciality lab to enhance the mechanics or to put together some sort of apparatus, so I resorted to fashioning a makeshift apparatus which served as my instruments: two Servo motors held upright by being taped to a pair of chopsticks, which was then held down by a weight (the candle).
