**Project Description**

I have decided to enhance some parts of my video game project [link] in order to make my game more immersive by incorporating Processing with Ardunio.  So, I looked through my project and decided to implement the following:
- Use the speaker (from Sparkfun Kit) to sound an affirming tune when the problem is fixed correctly or is not fixed correctly. 
- Use the potentiometer to determine one of four settings:
- Whether to use the sound of the static, the sound of the tune, neither, or both.
- Use the blue button to sound a tonal hint at the speaker to signal whether or not the cursor is close to the target for that problem.
- Use the green button to sound a tonal hint at the speaker to signal how many problems that you have fixed.

Things That Were Clever Or Tricky

**Mapping out what you wanted to do beforehand.**  As I am not an expert in programming, I am learning more and more, as I do these projects, that identifying a structure beforehand, before coding, makes your code much more organized, readable and editable as a code. 
**Having the optimal number of problems as 8.**  There are exactly 8 notes in an octave, so it was easy to come up with the hint for the green button concerning the number of problems fixed!
